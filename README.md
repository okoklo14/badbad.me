# Project Title

Source code for **badbad.me** website

## Getting Started

1. Choose a ready made HTML template (free or paid) that I like.
    > If a ready made one can provide much better quality, why reinvent the wheel?

2. Best if no compilation is required to produce CSS, JS, and HTML.

3. Tweak whatever necessary according to my domain, taste, etc.

4. Preview / QC. 

5. Checkin to Github repo.

6. Begin the setup in Netlify to integrate with this repo.

## Special Notes

- N/A for now as this is just a template to be used temporary during WIP stage.

## Netlify Locale
Language support is not an official feature yet. Using redirect as the workaround

    > Do not use force redirect (with "!")
